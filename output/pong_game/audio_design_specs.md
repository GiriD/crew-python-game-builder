## 2. Sound Effect Library Specification

### 2.1 Core Sound Event Mapping

**Event Trigger Table:**  
_All sounds mapped via the ECS systems and authorized state transitions (Observer pattern notifications)._

| Game Action / State      | Sound Effect Description                                        | Filename Suggestion          | Layering/Timing |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------|
| Ball hits paddle        | Tight, punchy neon zap; slight stereo pan to side hit           | ball_hit_paddle.wav         | Immediate      |
| Ball hits wall          | Short, reverberant metallic clink, fading quickly               | ball_hit_wall.wav           | Immediate      |
| Ball gains speed        | Rising digital swoosh/swell, layered with pulse mod (progressive)| speed_increase.wav          | 120-200ms tail |
| Ball spin applied       | Brief glitch/phase whirl, subtle stereo rotation                | spin_whirl.wav              | Sync with spin frame |
| Ball missed (score)     | Dramatic, explosive neon burst, layered with quick flash        | goal_explosion.wav          | Sync with score flash |
| Particle collision      | Short spark, randomized per burst, low layer in mix             | particle_impact.wav         | 30-60ms tail   |
| Paddle move             | Soft digital tick, velocity-dependent amplitude/pan             | paddle_move.wav             | Per frame/cadence |
| Serve start             | Charging digital “whoosh”, building to serve impulse            | serve_chargeup.wav          | 250ms fade-in  |
| Serve release           | Quick zap, resonant “snap”, reverb tail; synchronous with animation| serve_release.wav       | Immediate      |
| Scoreboard animate      | Numeric “flip” (mechanical with LED buzz, subtle polyphony)     | score_flip.wav              | Sync with animation |
| Win celebration         | Uplifting neon fanfare, layered synth arps, pitch riser         | win_fanfare.wav             | 1-2 sec, natively sync |
| Menu navigation         | Smooth, muted “beep” for each item, bright “confirm” for select | menu_beep.wav / menu_confirm.wav | Immediate      |
| Pause/Resume            | Deep digital pulse for pause, bright ascending blip for resume  | pause_in.wav / pause_out.wav| Immediate      |
| Error/Invalid           | Rapid buzz or muted error tone, matching UI reject animation    | ui_error.wav                | Immediate      |

**Ambient Layers:**
- **Dynamic court ambience**: Subtle, low-level neon hum, evolving as game intensity increases (loops/one-shots).
- **Background elements**: Low-volume, randomized stereo sweeps or electronic pulses (tied to dynamic backgrounds).

### 2.2 Sound Design Style Guide

- **Texture:** Clean, digitized, slightly analog synth textures blended with subtle reverb, “neon” styled resonance.
- **Stereo & Movement:** Panning tied to ball location, spin effects use rotating phase. Explosions and score flashes are wide stereo with layered sub-bass for punch.
- **Dynamics:** Attack fast (<25ms for actions), tails short (30–200ms), except celebration. All effects should mix below music peak to avoid masking.
- **Sampling Rate/Quality:** 48kHz, 16 or 24 bit, WAV preferred for development/export. Final .OGG or .WAV (see section 6).

## 3. Background Music Requirements

### 3.1 Mood and Integration

- **Core Theme:** Retro-futuristic synthwave, fast tempo with dynamic percussive layers, wide stereo imaging, compatible with neon/gradient visuals.
- **Adaptive Mixing:**  
  - _Game States_:  
    - **Menu:** Ambient, spacious pads with smooth digital motifs.  
    - **Serve:** Ramp-up, more energetic, “charging” theme.  
    - **Play:** Full theme—driving beat, rhythmic arpeggios, synth leads.  
    - **Score/Victory:** Triumphant, rising motif, transitions smoothly back to play or menu.  
    - **Pause:** Muted/filtered version of play music (LPF applied, <300Hz shelf).
- **Progressive Intensity:** Music layers increase as ball speed/difficulty rise (add drum/synth stems via state triggers).

### 3.2 Specifications

- **Tracks Required:**  
  - Main Play Theme (loopable, 2–3 min loop)  
  - Menu Theme (loopable, 1 min)  
  - Victory Fanfare (stinger, 3–5 sec)  
  - Pause Variations  
  - Ambient Underscore (low, dynamic layers for court)

- **Looping & Seamless Transitions:**  
  - All music must loop seamlessly (zero-crosspoint start/end, <5ms cross-fade).
  - Transitional cue points tagged in files for sync with state transitions.

- **Volume/Dynamics:**  
  - Default music playback at -12dB RMS (relative to effects peak).
  - Adaptive ducking—music fades back 3–6dB on score, victory, serve, or intense effect moments for clarity.

- **File Format:**  
  - .OGG or .WAV (uncompressed for best quality; fallback to .OGG for deployment).

## 4. Audio Feedback System & UI Integration

### 4.1 Playback Routing

- **GameSoundManager** singleton service, integrated with ECS.  
  - Listens for observer notifications from PhysicsSystem, ScoreSystem, MenuSystem, InputSystem, AnimationSystem.
- **State-Sensitive Playback:**  
  - Feedback tied to GameState; i.e., score effects play only on Score/Victory, paddle move effects only in Play state.
- **Audio UI Feedback:**  
  - Interactive beeps, confirmation tones for menu navigation, error tones for invalid actions—all played via the MenuSystem.

### 4.2 Timing and Synchronization

- All sound effect playback is frame-accurate:
  - **Immediate Playback:** Ball/paddle/wall collisions, joypad input, menu navigation.
  - **Synced Playback:** Effects like scoring flashes, serve sequences are triggered via observer with animationPhase callbacks for perfect sync with lighting/particle states.
- **Latency:** Audio events must be triggered within +/- 16ms of visual event (below 1 video frame at 60 FPS).

### 4.3 Volume & Mixing Controls

- **Mixer Structure:**  
  - **Channels:** master, music, sfx, ambient, ui  
  - **User Controls:**  
    - Master Volume  
    - Music Volume  
    - SFX Volume  
    - UI/Feedback Volume  
  - **UI:** Accessible from pause/options menu, real-time preview on adjustment.

- **Balance Guidelines:**  
  - SFX peak level approx. -6dB relative to music peak.
  - Score/win effects may momentarily reach -3dB for prominence.
  - Ambient sounds remain below -20dB RMS, never mask main music or effects.

### 4.4 Audio Settings/Options

- **In-Game Settings:** Preset profiles: “Balanced”, “Music Focus”, “SFX Focus”, “Mute Music”, “Mute SFX”, “Low Volume”.
- **Configurable Output Device:** Access default device; possible future expansion for device switching.
- **Mute/Unmute:** Dedicated easy-access key or menu toggle.

## 5. File Format and Quality Recommendations

- **Sound Effects:**
  - _Development:_ 48kHz, 16–24 bit WAV.
  - _Deployment:_ OGG Vorbis (44.1kHz min, 128–192kbps), kept below 250ms duration per file unless otherwise specified.
- **Music:**
  - _Development:_ WAV or FLAC stems.
  - _Deployment:_ OGG Vorbis (192–320kbps for main themes), loop-boundaries clearly marked.
- **Naming & Organization:**
  - Consistent folder under `/assets/sounds/` (effects), `/assets/music/` (music), organized by system/event.

- **Metadata:** All music tracks tagged for loop-points and transition marks; sound effects have descriptive filenames, include documentation mapping event ID → filename.

---

## 6. Implementation Guidelines (pygame Specific)

**Recommended pygame audio classes:**  
- `pygame.mixer` for channel mixing, volume fades, playback control.
- Use `pygame.mixer.Sound` for short SFX (~250ms or less);  
  `pygame.mixer.music` for longer background loops.

**Audio System Architecture:**
- Centralize asset loading on start (preload WAV/OGG).
- Assign fixed mixer channels:  
  - Channel 0: Music  
  - Channel 1: Main SFX  
  - Channel 2: UI SFX  
  - Channel 3+: Ambient/dynamic (particle bursts, background sweeps)
- Lock audio calls to ECS events; use observer pattern for Score, Paddle, Ball, and Menu actions.
- All SFX triggered via a dedicated `play_sfx(event_id, location=None)` function; `location` for panning.
- Duck music for key SFX via music fade (`pygame.mixer.music.set_volume()`).

**Performance:**
- Limit concurrent SFX playback (8–16 simultaneous sounds max).
- Pool loaded Sound objects—do not reload per play.
- All channels have their volume states bound to UI/setting config; update mapping in real-time from options menu.

---

## 7. Performance Considerations

- **Low Latency:** All sound effects must be triggered within a single game frame (preferably <10ms delay via preloading and channel assignment).
- **Resource Management:**  
  - Load assets once per session; release only on state/game exit.
  - Particle collision sounds use randomized playback from a short SFX pool, pooled and recycled.
  - Use threading only for non-blocking music transition effects, never for event SFX.
- **Scalability:**  
  - Future expansion—music stems for increased layers, new effects for new ball types/modes.
  - Configuration hooks for adding/removing SFX channels for complex environments.
