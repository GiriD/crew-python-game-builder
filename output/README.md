# Generated Games Output

This folder contains the Python game files generated by the Game Builder Crew.

Each successful crew run will create:
- `{game_name}_game.py` - The complete Python game code
- Additional files as needed for specific games

## Running Generated Games

To run a generated game:
```bash
python {game_name}_game.py
```

Make sure you have the required dependencies installed (pygame, etc.) if needed by the specific game.
